# Notes Manager

## Description 

The Notes Manager app was created as a tool for business managers. It can be difficult as a manager to manage both large and small tasks, but Notes Manager makes this a bit easier by organizing notes in one convenient location. This app uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
